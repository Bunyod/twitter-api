## Description
I want to 
- implement a REST API that, given a twitter username and a count N, returns the last N tweets shouted.
Shouting a tweet consists of transforming it to uppercase and adding an exclamation mark at the end.
- get a cache layer of these tweets in order to avoid hitting Twitter's API (which let's imagine is very expensive) twice for
the same username given a T time.

## Example 

Given these last two tweets from Donald Trump:
- "Big announcement with my friend Ambassador Nikki Haley in the Oval Office at 10:30am",
- "Will be going to Iowa tonight for Rally, and more! The Farmers (and all) are very happy with USMCA!"

The returned response should be:
```
curl -s http://localhost:9000/shout/realDonaldTrump?limit=2
[
    "BIG ANNOUNCEMENT WITH MY FRIEND AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY IN THE OVAL OFFICE AT 10:30AM!",
    "WILL BE GOING TO IOWA TONIGHT FOR RALLY, AND MORE! THE FARMERS (AND ALL) ARE VERY HAPPY WITH USMCA!"
]
```

## Constraints 
- Count N provided MUST be equal or less than 10. If not, our API should return an error.

## Structure
- `ShoutController` and `Starter`: Web server done in Akka HTTP.
- `TweetRepository` and `TweetRepositoryInMemory`: We want you to work on domain code. Therefore, we provide an in-memory
    implementation of the Twitter repository that returns random quotes about science üßê. `TwitterRepositoryInMemory` as a production implementation.
- `Tweet` domain model: Simple case class for modeling Tweets returned by `TweetRepository`.


 `runMain com.bunic.introcats.Starter` inside the sbt console. By default it runs on port 9000.

## What will I evaluate?
* **Design:** We know this is a very simple application and can be solved with one line of code but we want to see how
    you design domain code. Let's pretend this is a super critical application for the company and you're going to maintain
    it (and make changes requested by the product owner) for years.
* **Testing:** We love automated testing and we love reliable tests. We like testing for two reasons: First, good tests
    let us deploy to production without fear (even on a Friday!). Second, tests give a fast feedback cycle so developers
    in dev phase know if their changes are breaking anything.
* **Simplicity**: We like separate code in domain, application and infrastructure layers. If our product owner asks us
    for the same application but accessed by command line (instead of the http server) it should be super easy!

# Conventions

## Traits
Use an [adjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective), e.g., `trait Configurable`.

## Testing
Because *route unit tests* (not to be confused with integration tests) must not depend on 
business service logic (e.g. `domain.ShoutService`), I mock those calls by
`when(svc.tweets(...)).thenReturn(mock)`.

# Known issues

## Configuration via Pureconfig
Pureconfig's config file does not support uppercase and underscores. [Read here](https://github.com/pureconfig/pureconfig/issues/394)

## How to use sbt-coverage

Run the tests with enabled coverage:
```
$ sbt clean test
```

To generate the coverage reports run
```
$ sbt coverageReport
```

Coverage reports will be in target/scala-2.12/scoverage-report/index.html.

## Run
```
$ sbt run
```
